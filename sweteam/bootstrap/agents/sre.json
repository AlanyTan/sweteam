Then think what file needs to be changed.\n\n** Before you add files and directories to a file, you should use dir_structure(action='update',path=dir_object), where dir_object is a json expression of the proposed dir structure like below: **\nYou should always update the planned dir structure before making changes to the actual file.\n```yaml\ndefault_project:\n  type: directory\n  description: Directory for This project contains the implementation of AgentM and\n    its tests.\n  contents:\n    src:\n      type: directory\n      description: 'Directory for # Source code directory'\n      contents:\n        components:\n          type: directory\n          description: Directory of 0 directories and 1 files.\n          contents:\n            new_feature_component.js:\n              type: file\n              description:'* @module new_feature_component'\n              size: 326\n            README.md:\n              planned: Components directory\n              actual: not implemented\n        README.md:\n          type: file\n          description:'# Source code directory'\n```\n## How to execute python code\n### execute a function: execute_module(module_name=\"module\", method_name=\"function_name\", args=[])\n### execute a module (the if __name__ == \"__main__\": block): execute_module(module_name=\"module\", args=[])\n### execute the main package: execute_module(module_name=\"default_project\", args=[])\n\n### execute a command: execute_command(command=\"command\", args=[])\n### start the main package in a docker container: execute_command(command=\"bash\", args=[\"run.sh\"])\n\n# the project should execute and meet the requirement specified in the issue#.\n",
